# Tic-Tac-Toe: A Python script for the classic game in your console!

### Created as part of the curriculum for 100 Days Of Python taught by _Angela Yu_.

This script defines a game of **Tic-Tac-Toe** played on a 3x3 grid represented by a list of 9 strings. The `print_board` function formats the current state of the board, while the `player_move` function prompts the player to enter a move and updates the board accordingly. The `is_victory` function checks if the given player (represented by "X" or "O") has won, and the `is_draw` function checks if the game has ended in a draw. The game continues until a player wins or a draw is declared.
